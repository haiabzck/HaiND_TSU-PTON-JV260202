        The domestic cat is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae. <br/>Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the <br/>domestication of the cat started in the Near East around 7500 BCE. Today,<br/>  the domestic cat occurs across the globe and is valued by humans for<br/>  companionship and its ability to kill vermin. It is commonly kept as a <br/>pet, working cat, and pedigreed cat shown at cat fancy events. Out of the<br/>  estimated 600 million domestic cats worldwide, 400 million reside in Asia,<br/>  including 58 million in China. The United States leads in cat ownership<br/> with 73.8 million cats, followed by the United Kingdom with approximately<br/>  10.9 million cats. It also ranges freely as a feral cat, avoiding human <br/> contact. Pet abandonment contributes to increasing of the global feral <br/> cat population, which has driven the decline of bird, mammal, and reptile <br/> species. Population control includes spaying and neutering.
